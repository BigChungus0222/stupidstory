        <p>For anyone who would want to read this,</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">So there was this dude called <del>Bryan</del> Brian and he liked to <del>sleep with people</del> 
            play games with his friends during sleepovers. During sleepovers he likes to suck on dic....... wait i mean lollipops while playing games.
        </p> 
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">After that background information which has nothing to do with the story or whatever, lets get to the actual part of this story. So one day Brian went to check his mailbox, and he found an invitation..... from Diddy!? Brian was very overhyped, for this party
             was tonight (yo that rhymes). The location was set for the public bathroom right next to Diddy's house, who is actually Brian's
              neighbor (yes Brian lives in the public bathroom)
        </p>

            As the party started, a song started to play.

        <pre>I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
            They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
            I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
            Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
            
            I'm in my prime, and this ain't even final form
            They knocked me down, but still, my feet, they find the floor
            I went from living rooms straight out to sold out tours
            Life's a fight, but trust, I'm ready for the war
            
            Woah-oh-oh
            This is how the story goes
            Woah-oh-oh
            I guess this is how the story goes
            
            I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
            They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
            I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
            Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
            
            From the screen to the ring, to the pen, to the king
            Where's my crown? That's my bling
            Always drama when I ring
            See, I believe that if I see it in my heart
            Smash through the ceiling 'cause I'm reaching for the stars
            
            Woah-oh-oh
            This is how the story goes
            Woah-oh-oh
            I guess this is how the story goes
            
            I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
            They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze (Woo)

            Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told
            
            Highway to heaven, I'm just cruisin' by my lone'
            They cast me out, left me for dead, them people cold
            My faith in God, mind in the sun, I'm 'bout to sow (Yeah)
            My life is hard, I took the wheel, I cracked the code (Yeah-yeah, woah-oh-oh)
            Ain't nobody gon' save you, man, this life will break you (Yeah, woah-oh-oh)
